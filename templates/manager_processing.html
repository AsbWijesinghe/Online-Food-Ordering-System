The challenge for us is to make a versatile website and smartphone app that is simple and 
easy to use. What we have learned is that ordering food online is way easier, faster and has 
less complications than calling. What makes onlinefood better than the traditional order over 
the phone method?

meal ahead from the best restaurants near you and avoid the rush hours
