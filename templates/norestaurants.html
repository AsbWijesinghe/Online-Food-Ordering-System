<b>Ordering food is easy as ABC Only 4 steps to make the order, easy payment, available 24/7

<pre class="definition">
The challenge for us is to make a versatile website and smartphone app that is simple and 
easy to use. What we have learned is that ordering food online is way easier, faster and has 
less complications than calling. What makes onlinefood better than the traditional order over 
the phone method?

24/7: Our site and app are available 24/7 with the feature to pre-order. You can plan your 
meal ahead from the best restaurants near you and avoid the rush hours
Free to use: Browse through 4000+ restaurant menus for free
Order food in 4 simple steps
Easy Payment: Do you prefer online payment? We accept all major credit cards as well as
PayTM Wallet. If you prefer to pay cash on delivery in Indian Rupees, weâ€™ve got that covered too.
